1 Introduction

In this project, you will use MIPS assembly program to implement a (modified and simpler) Tetris Game.

Tetris is a puzzle video game created by Soviet software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. It has been published by several companies for multiple platforms.

Fig. 1: Snapshot of Tetris Game

Figure 1 shows a snapshot of COMP2611 Tetris game. In Tetris, players complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces, called ‚Äútetrominoes‚Äù, which descend onto the playing field. (In what follows, we call ‚Äútetrominoes‚Äù as ‚Äúblocks‚Äù.) The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the uncleared lines reach the top of the playing field. The longer the player can delay this outcome, the higher their score will be.

In this project, we implement a simpler version of Tetris.

2 Coordinate System

The game field is of 10√ó23 squares area as illustrated in Figure 2. The top-left corner square is (0, 0) and the bottom-right corner square is consequently (9, 22).

Fig. 2: The coordinate system

The space that the block can reach is limited to the first 22 rows (e.g. row 0 to row 21). The last row is the bottom border. The game field is encoded as a two-dimensional bitmap array: 0 for available, and 1 for occupied or the bottom border.

3 Game Objects

There is only one game object, block (tetromino) in this project. There are 7 types of blocks available to choose from. All blocks are made of four squares. The block switches in between four modes (sequentially anti-clockwise) by rotation. Attributes for a block are listed below.

¬≤ block_x_loc: the current x coordinate of the block

¬≤ block_y_loc: the current y coordinate of the block

¬≤ block_mode: the mode of the current block

¬≤ block_id: the type of current block

When the block moves to left or right, its x coordinate will be updated. When it moves down, its y coordinate will be updated. Rotation doesn‚Äôt update the (x, y) coordinates of the block, but it does change the location of the squares in the block. Calculation of the coordinate of each square in a block will be introduced in Section 5.1.

Table 1 shows some detailed information about the attributes of blocks.

4 Game Details

You should also read comments in the skeleton code to know more about game details. 4.1 Game initialization

The initial game setting, block properties, and game field matrix are stored in the Data Segment of memory. Before the game starts, we initialize the game via init_game in the skeleton code. The block object is created via a syscall. After using syscall 100, a GUI will appear and generate the first two blocks. And this syscall will return the ID of the current block.

4.2 Player actions

The player can also pause the game with ‚Äúp‚Äù, it can stop the block from moving down automatically which is very useful in debugging.

4.3 Game functions

The block keeps falling during the game. This down action can be performed by the player or the free fall. When the block can‚Äôt fall downwards anymore, the game needs to check whether the game is over. If the game is not over yet, the game needs to check whether there are full rows in the game field matrix and update accordingly. At last, a new block is created to start the next round of game.

4.4 Winning and Losing Conditions

The player will lose the game when the fixed squares reach the top of the game field and prevent the arrival of additional blocks.

The game never ends with the player‚Äôs victory. The player can only complete as many lines as possible before an inevitable loss.

5 Game Implementation

5.1 Data Structure

The game field is encoded in a 2D matrix of size 10√ó23. Each cell is initialized to be 0 (e.g. empty) except the last row to be 1 (e.g., bottom wall). It is internally saved as a 1D array basic_matrix_bitmap (row-major).

When the block is rotated, its (x, y) coordinates remains the same. But the locations of the four squares in the block need to be updated. This can be a tedious work. We simplify this by introducing two mode matrices of size 16 x 7, one for the x coordinate of squares and the other for the y coordinate of squares.

For example, suppose the Type I block is now in location (x, y) and mode 2. Then by referring to Fig 3 first row, third column, we know the x coordinates of four squares in the block are x-1, x+0, x+1 and x+2.

Fig. 3: Data structure of the mode matrix

The mode matrices are 2D and are internally saved as 1D arrays mode_x_loc and mode_y_loc (row-major). Adding the current x coordinate of the block‚Äôs location (block_x_loc) with the corresponding relative x coordinate in mode_x_loc, you can get its absolute x coordinate of the squares. For the y coordinate, it‚Äôs the same.

Other game-related data are saved in quite a few variables and simple 1D arrays. All data structures used are static. Check the data segment of the skeleton at the very beginning of the skeleton code. Make sure you understand the data type of each variable carefully.

5.2 Game Loop

During game initialization, init_game creates the game objects and puts them in the game canvas.

The game then starts. It works as a big loop. Each iteration follows a collection of steps, e.g., checks game status; gets the keyboard input; executes player instruction; checks whether auto down, etc. Toward the beginning of each game iteration, losing conditions are checked to decide whether the game continues or not.

6 Tasks

When you code with high-level programming language, you always go through problem specification, algorithm design/workflow analysis, coding, debugging and documentation. Coding with low-level assembly programming language is pretty much the same.

‚ÄôDivide-n-conquer‚Äô strategy is used in the skeleton. The skeleton code is loooong, but you will find it is well organized with sub-tasks handled by different MIPS procedures. The tasks of the programming assignment include a reading task (Task 0), you will need to read through the skeleton and grasp a big picture of the code structure.

The remaining tasks (Task 1-5) are coding tasks. You will focus on implementing a few MIPS procedures with well-defined interface.

6.1 Task 0 Reading Task

Spend a few hours to read the skeleton code. You should 1. understand the data structures used in the skeleton; 2. trace the game loop 3. figure out the functionality of each procedure.

Show your understanding of the big picture of the project by drawing a flow chart (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart). Feel free to draw the flow chart with drawing tools or simple paper-and-pencil.

Your flowchart should

‚Äì include enough details, e.g., every single procedure should be included in your flow chart.

‚Äì have good layout so that it‚Äôs easy to trace and understand.

6.2 Task 1 to 5 Programming Tasks

Once you build up a big picture of the project, you can zoom into the following coding tasks.

Table 2 lists all the programming tasks you need to implement. For some programming tasks in the skeleton code, you need to remove the code in the answer space and write your own code.

Note: You should not modify the skeleton code but only add your code to those procedures. Try to follow good conventions, e.g. comment your code properly and use registers wisely.

You can discuss with your friends if you have difficulty in understanding it. But every single line of your code should be your own work (not something copied from your friends). Do not show your code to others. Do not upload your code to GitHub or cloud unless you set the access right to be private.

Table 2: Programming Tasks

7 Syscall Services

A modified MARS (NewMars.jar) with additional set of syscall services is needed to support the game (e.g. fancy UI, music, etc.). Table 3 list all the provides syscall services to implement the game.

Note that the Basic matrix for game field exists in both Java code and MIPS code. The two matrices are initialized the same. The Basic matrix in MIPS is used for logical operations, and the one in java is for the GUI to draw correctly. Every time the MIPS basic matrix is updated, the Java basic matrix is also updated to keep them synchronized.
